# Example Notebooks

This repository contains a number of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks with examples from the Materials Modelling lectures.

> You will need a working Jupyter installation with Python, Numpy, and Fenics to execute most of the code. You can also clone that notebook on the lab1 JupyterHub instance. All required software should already be installed there.
